## C++ SentenceSplitter library with Python interface

### A lightwight utility for c++ and python to process text into sentences.

README.txt for the old distutil distribution:

The splitter module is a text to sentences splitter for python3.9. The module is written in c++ for Debian Bullseye platform only. It may run in other environments, but I have no other environment around, so neither need not opportunity to port it. 

Usage:

```python
from splitter import splitter as split

splittedList = split("en",text_to_split)
```

Requires:

`apt-get install libpcre2-dev` 
`api-get install python3-dev`

Bulding:

run make pymodule (or python3 setup.py build) to see if the module builds on your site. Find a location for the prefixes (/usr/local/share/ssplit default, see src/ssplit.h) and copy them to that location. 

Now python3 test.py should produce some sentences. 

If successfull, install the module with pyhton3 setup.py install. 

By default, setup.py will install the module to Pythons "purelib" directory, which depends a bit on your pyhton environment. In case you want to have it elsewhere, set Install_Dir in setup.py. 

Thats it.
